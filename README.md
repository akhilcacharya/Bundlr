#Bundler
Written in Node.js on top of the Express.js framework, Bundler is a super simple application that lets you "bundle" multiple URLs into one, simple url. Think bit.ly, except I made it :)

It was a pretty cool learning experience, as I hadn't had a real encounter with Node.js or MongoDB before. Not exactly the *best* use of the language and framework, but hey. 

I whippped this up while in a sleep deprived state in a few hours, and worked out the kinks a few days later. Remember, its REALLY rough around the edges. Take a look if you want, but its not at all production ready. Think of it as an less than Minimum Viable Product. 

#Todo:
I want to...

* Improve styling - move away from Twitter Bootstrap and get something custom. 

* Improve documentation. Seriously, no comments. I'm a terrible person. I'll push that forward. 

* Do ACTUAL form validation. use jQuery to post the data instead of using HTML forms. 

* Trim the fat. I've got a few more packages than I need right now. 


I'll get to all of these in due time.
